    <h1>Bentota turtle hatchery</h1>
  <p>
    The Bentota Turtle Hatchery is a non-profit organization located in Sri Lanka. It was founded in 1981 by Mr. Dudley Perera, who was inspired to start the hatchery after witnessing the plight of sea turtles in the area.

The hatchery is located on a beach in Bentota, which is a popular tourist destination. The hatchery is open to the public, and visitors can learn about the conservation of sea turtles and see the turtles in their natural habitat.

The hatchery's mission is to protect sea turtles and their eggs. The hatchery does this by collecting sea turtle eggs from the beach and incubating them in a safe environment. Once the turtles hatch, they are released back into the ocean.

The hatchery has been very successful in its mission. Over the years, the hatchery has released over 100,000 sea turtles into the ocean. The hatchery has also helped to raise awareness about the importance of sea turtle conservation.

The Bentota Turtle Hatchery is a valuable resource for the conservation of sea turtles. The hatchery is doing important work to protect these amazing creatures, and it is a must-visit for any visitor to Sri Lanka.
